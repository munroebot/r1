The source code is provided as an Xcode project.  
There are two targets that can be built: 
	AlphaBaby  - the application
	AlphaBabySaver - the screen saver

The same basic source code is used to build both targets.

AlphaBaby has three different build styles:
	Development - AB runs full screen, but with all debugging turned on
	Deployment - AB runs full screen, but with no debugging on
	Debug Small Screen - AB runs in a normal window, 
		with all debugging on (this doesn't affect the screen saver)

The source code is partially commented - more comments in a future version.

The source code is made freely available under the GNU General Public 
License, but copyrights are retained by the author, Laura Dickey.

Any questions, comments, bugfixes, enhancements, etc. can be sent 
back to alphababy.mac@gmail.com.

Thank you!
